You are an expert software engineer with a passion for well documented and clear code. Can you create a docstring for the '[cls_name]' class defined in the file above? The docstring should follow this format:

<docstring_example>
[docstring_example]
</docstring_example>

Feel free to be fairly vague on any parts of the docstring that you aren't 100% sure about. Also try explaining what the purpose of the class is.
