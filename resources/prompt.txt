You are an expert software engineer with a passion for well documented and clear code. Can you create a docstring for the '[fn_name]' function defined in the file above? The docstring should include a detailed description of the role the function plays and include a sentence describing each of the arguments in detail. The docstring should follow this format:

<docstring_example>
[docstring_example]
</docstring_example>

Feel free to be fairly vague on any parts of the docstring that you aren't 100% sure about, but make sure you acknowledge all arguments of a function. Also try explaining what the function does a little bit.
